## Reinventing Event Tickets for a Smarter Future

At **HashPass**, we’re reinventing how event tickets work by transforming them into secure, smart digital passes powered by blockchain. These passes go far beyond entry—they enable loyalty programs, real-time access control, and post-event engagement, all in a single super-app.
