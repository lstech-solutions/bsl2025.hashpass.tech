## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Missing frontend definition in buildspec"
**Fix:** Change build specification from `buildspec.yml` to `amplify.yml` in Amplify Console

### Issue: Wrong config being used
**Fix:** Copy correct config (`amplify-main.yml` or `amplify-bsl2025.yml`) into Amplify Console build settings

### Issue: All events showing in single-event branch
**Fix:** Verify `AMPLIFY_SHOW_ALL_EVENTS=false` is set in environment variables

### Issue: Routes returning 404
**Fix:** Check redirects in amplify.yml match available routes for that branch

### Issue: "User s3 is not authorized to perform s3:GetObject on deployment bucket"
**Fix:** 
1. Configure Amplify service role in Amplify Console (App settings → General → Service role)
2. Remove `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` from Amplify environment variables
3. See `docs/AMPLIFY-SERVICE-ROLE-CONFIG.md` for detailed instructions

### Issue: "A dynamic import callback was not specified" during environment initialization
**Fix:**
1. Add `export AMPLIFY_SKIP_BACKEND_BUILD=true` to `amplify.yml` preBuild phase
2. This disables Amplify CLI auto-initialization (not needed for static hosting)
3. See `docs/AMPLIFY-DYNAMIC-IMPORT-ERROR.md` for detailed instructions
